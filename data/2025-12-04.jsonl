For this, we first construct Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ by lifting Amiot's construction of Calabi-Yau structures on Verdier quotients to the dg level. Then we prove base change properties relating Calabi-Yau structures over $R$ to those over the base field $k$. As a result, we prove the existence of a right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category associated with $Λ$ which is a cyclic lift of the weak Calabi-Yau structure constructed by the first-named author and Iyama. We also show the existence of a left Calabi-Yau structure on the dg bounded derived category of $Λ$. This is a non-commutative generalization of a result by Brav and Dyckerhoff. By combining the existence of the right Calabi-Yau structure on the dg singularity category with a structure theorem by Keller and the second-named author, we deduce that under suitable hypotheses, the singularity category associated with $Λ$ is triangle equivalent to a generalized cluster category in the sense of Amiot."}

Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph."}

We will also propose a conjectural comparison for general non-tempered Hamiltonian spaces."}

In particular, we prove an analogue of the Harish-Chandra isomorphism and we introduce an analogue of parabolic induction. We use these tools to classify the non-unitary irreducible representations of $q$-deformed $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$. Moreover, we explicitly show how they converge to the classical admissible dual of $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$.

We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results.
