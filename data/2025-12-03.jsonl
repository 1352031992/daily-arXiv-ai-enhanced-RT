We generalize these theorems in two natural settings. The first is based on the idea that complex reductive algebraic groups are the natural complex-geometric counterparts of compact Lie groups. Using new definitions of Poisson and symplectic slices, we prove analogues of the classical symplectic slice theorems for Hamiltonian actions of complex reductive algebraic groups. These analogues have versions in the complex-algebraic and holomorphic categories, and make extensive use of Slodowy slices and decomposition classes in complex reductive Lie algebras. The starting point for our second setting is the fact that Hamiltonian Lie group actions are special cases of Hamiltonian symplectic groupoid actions. We generalize the classical symplectic slice theorems to the latter case."}

Quotients by these parabolic subgroups represent orbits of flags, and their cardinalities asymptotically reveal entropies (as rates of exponential or superexponential growth). The multiplicative \"chain rules\" that involve these cardinalities induce, asymptotically, additive analogues for entropies. Many traditional formulas in information theory correspond to quotients of symmetric groups, which are a particular kind of reflection group; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by multinomial coefficients and are asymptotically related to Shannon entropy. One can treat similarly quotients of the general linear groups over a finite field; in this case, the cardinalities of orbits are given by $q$-multinomials and are asymptotically related to the Tsallis 2-entropy. In this contribution, we consider other finite reflection groups as well as the symplectic group as an example of a classical group over a finite field (groups of Lie type). In both cases, the groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams into infinite series of similar groups $A_n$, $B_n$, $C_n$, $D_n$ and a finite number of exceptional ones. The $A_n$ series consists of the symmetric groups (reflection case) and general linear groups (Lie case). Some of the other series, studied here from an information-theoretic perspective for the first time, are linked to new entropic functionals."}

Let $W$ be an absolutely irreducible $\\mathbb{F}_qH$--module such that, over an algebraic closure, $W$ is isomorphic (up to Frobenius twists) to a tensor product $\\bigotimes_{t=1}^r L(λ^{(t)})$, where each $L(λ^{(t)})$ is an irreducible polynomial representation of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$ of degree $k_t$, and the total degree $K=\\sum_t k_t$ satisfies $K<q-1$. We prove a base-$q$ injectivity lemma which shows that, for a Singer cycle $s \\in H$, the eigenvalues of $s$ on $W \\otimes_{\\mathbb{F}_q} \\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$ are parametrised by digit vectors of length $d$ with entries bounded by $K$. In particular, distinct weights of $W$ correspond to distinct eigenvalues. If in addition $W$ is multiplicity-free for the diagonal torus of $\\mathrm{GL}_d$, then every eigenspace of $s$ is one-dimensional, so $s$ has a simple spectrum on $W$. Using this spectral property we design a Las Vegas rewriting algorithm which, given $G \\leq \\mathrm{GL}(W)$ isomorphic to $H$ and acting irreducibly on $W$, constructs a projective representation of $G$ of degree $d$ equivalent to the natural representation of $H$. The expected running time is polynomial in $d$, $\\log q$ and $K$, and in the cost of field operations and discrete logarithm computations in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^d}$. This extends earlier rewriting algorithms of Magaard--O'Brien--Seress and of Gül--Ankaralıoğlu to a broader class of twisted tensor products of polynomial modules."}

We will see that this problem naturally leads to studying when certain antichain modules are perfect modules.

Accepted to FOCS 2025", "summary": "Many natural computational problems in computer science, mathematics, physics, and other sciences amount to deciding if two objects are equivalent. Often this equivalence is defined in terms of group actions. A natural question is to ask when two objects can be distinguished by polynomial functions that are invariant under the group action. For finite groups, this is the usual notion of equivalence, but for continuous groups like the general linear groups it gives rise to a new notion, called orbit closure intersection. It captures, among others, the graph isomorphism problem, noncommutative PIT, null cone problems in invariant theory, equivalence problems for tensor networks, and the classification of multiparty quantum states. Despite recent algorithmic progress in celebrated special cases, the computational complexity of general orbit closure intersection problems is currently quite unclear. In particular, tensors seem to give rise to the most difficult problems.\n  In this work we start a systematic study of orbit closure intersection from the complexity-theoretic viewpoint. To this end, we define a complexity class TOCI that captures the power of orbit closure intersection problems for general tensor actions, give an appropriate notion of algebraic reductions that imply polynomial-time reductions in the usual sense, but are amenable to invariant-theoretic techniques, identify natural tensor problems that are complete for TOCI, including the equivalence of 2D tensor networks with constant physical dimension, and show that the graph isomorphism problem can be reduced to these complete problems, hence GI$\\subseteq$TOCI. As such, our work establishes the first lower bound on the computational complexity of orbit closure intersection problems, and it explains the difficulty of finding unconditional polynomial-time algorithms beyond special cases, as has been observed in the literature."}
