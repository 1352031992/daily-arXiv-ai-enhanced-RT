One\nof these is that the Adams operations on its Grothendieck group are trivial. In\nthis paper, we prove three theorems inspired by this. Theorem A states that the\nDelannoy category is the unique semi-simple pre-Tannakian category having a\ngenerator that is fixed by the second Adams operation and whose exterior powers\nare simple. Theorem B states the Delannoy category is uniquely determined by\nits Grothendieck semi-ring (among semi-simple pre-Tannakian categories). This\nis reminiscent of Kazhdan--Wenzl's recognition theorem for quantum\n$\\mathfrak{gl}_n$, and many subsequent results. Finally, Theorem C establishes\nsome properties of pre-Tannakian categories where the second Adams operation\nfixes a generator."}
